 The run_analysis function writes a table (FinalDS.txt) with the following characteristics :

I. 8 variables (columns) 
II. 180 measurements (rows). 

The variables are listed and described in order of appearance.
 
"SubjectID", contains the ID numbers of each volunteer that performed the six activities in the experiment (30 subjects).
"Activity", contains the names of the 6 activities that subjects performed.
"mean.tBodyAccMeanX", contains the average of the estimated mean of the body acceleration X time domain signals
"mean.tBodyAccMeanY", contains the average of the estimated mean of the body acceleration Y time domain signals
"mean.tBodyAccMeanZ", contains the average of the estimated mean of the body acceleration Z time domain signals
"mean.tBodyAccStdX", contains the average of the estimated standard deviation of the body acceleration X time domain signals
"mean.tBodyAccStdY", contains the average of the estimated standard deviation of the body acceleration Y time domain signals
"mean.tBodyAccStdZ", contains the average of the estimated standard deviation of the body acceleration Z time domain signals
